        <h1>ABOUT</h1>
        
		<h2>I am from the Massachusetts Northshore where I grew up sailing, hiking and exploring the outdoors. From a young age I loved taking pictures and crafting with my hands. In highshchool, I developed these skills by developing my own film and took a special interest in sculpture. Following graduation, I decided to pursue Graphic Design at Massachusetts College of Art and design, where I became fascinated with the ability to communicate through imagery and organization of information.I continue to be inspired by the outdoors through cycling, sailing and traveling and am always looking for a new adventure.</h2>
